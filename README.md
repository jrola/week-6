Validate Form

Letâ€™s revisit form validation from week 2.  You will use your same form but create some new JavaScript.

Requirements:
1.	Using regular expression to validate your form.
a.	First name must be a noSpaceAlphaValidate
b.	Last name is just a spaceAlphaValidate
c.	Email must start with characters, have a @ symbol, have another set of characters have a period and end with 3 characters.
d.	Comments must not have any html.  Search for charaters that have <> wrapped around it.
2.	Note you can use string objects to help you.
